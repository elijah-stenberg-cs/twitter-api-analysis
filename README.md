# twitter-api-analysis

This project demonstrates a Python pipeline for collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing Twitter data using Tweepy (v2), Pandas, and TextBlob. The notebook includes sentiment analysis and basic engagement metrics visualization, showcasing skills in data science, natural language processing (NLP), and Python programming.
Note: Live data collection is limited by the free (Essential) Twitter API. The pipeline is fully functional for Premium API access or sample data.
